        <title>The Waves</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;A perfect novel, making the second perfect novel I have read, after Ulysses. I could maybe write more, but what is the point of writing, when it already has been done, perfectly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woolf is of course different from Joyce. I have been poisoned by a simplification once read: Woolf is of the mind, Joyce of the body, and that seems probably true to the extent that simplification can be true. And there being difference opens up the point that there are multiple ways of being perfect, or even, lesser goal, being good. So maybe there is reason to write, maybe there is reason to read other things still. Yet the clarity, the beauty, the simplicity -&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Man</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating and insightful biography of both a guy I, an ignoramus, had not heard of, as well as of American foreign policy over the last half-century. Lots of good stuff here, sharply written, my biggest takeaway being that I am not entirely convinced that foreign policy actually effects change. I mean it probably does something?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Virginian</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Good, solid, manly. Wister is clearly the Tolkein of the Western genre, and that caught me a bit by surprise - the seeds and bones of the genre are so clear and well-put, it feels like &lt;em&gt;The Virginian&lt;/em&gt; precisely predicts the existence of Clint Eastwood and Larry McMurtry. Also just kind of surprisingly unobjectionable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The story of a cabin over the centuries and the story of America and the story of some ghosts, cute and sweet. A bit overwrought and maybe a bit fanciful at times, trying too hard to write with &lt;em&gt;styles&lt;/em&gt;, but I can forgive that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2666</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I have believed that a truly great novel is one which contains a sliver of divinity, something which makes me want to believe in the power and glory of God. As an atheist, that feels like a sufficiently high bar, and the books that have passed it - say &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/The-Brothers-Karamzov&quot;&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/East-of-Eden&quot;&gt;East of Eden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude&quot;&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; - feel well within the bounds of the canonical greats. &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; disproves this, as &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a great novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; also has the dubious distinction of being maybe the best book which I don’t know that I am capable of recommending. It is a grueling read. I’m not sure about the ethics of &lt;em&gt;The Part About the Crimes&lt;/em&gt; - it feels questionable, writing so many murders and rapes, reading so many murders and rapes. I had to make the decision a number of times to proceed against the wind there, and I don’t really see myself revisiting it. And yet - &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; is a book of immense power, of visceral realism that is I think maybe unmatched. Bolaño does fascinating things with fragmentation, coming together, resolving and yet leaving unresolved, not telling a story and not writing of characters so much as writing of a destination, a place where people come…to die? To unravel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good writing is often described as musical, with harmonies and crescendos and trills. The writing in &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;percussive&lt;/em&gt; in nature, rhythmic, relentless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/The-Savage-Detectives&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Savage Detectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; left me a bit unsure about Bolaño. I thought it was good, but missing something or evading something. I’m still not sure if I missed something, but with the context of 2666 I think I understand better the project there and the flow there, and perhaps that is one I need to revisit. Perhaps this is a book you should visit, let it get under your skin and consume and consume.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I have believed that a truly great novel is one which contains a sliver of divinity, something which makes me want to believe in the power and glory of God. As an atheist, that feels like a sufficiently high bar, and the books that have passed it - say &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/The-Brothers-Karamzov&quot;&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/East-of-Eden&quot;&gt;East of Eden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude&quot;&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; - feel well within the bounds of the canonical greats. &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; disproves this, as &lt;em&gt;2666&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a great novel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Bostonians</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I read &lt;em&gt;The Bostonians&lt;/em&gt; coming fresh off of reading &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/Cloud-Cuckoo-Land&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Cuckoo Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I am a bit astonished at the contrast. The latter is a contemporary novel with an obvious underlying ethos which I am predominantly in line with, but feels flat and a bit lifeless. &lt;em&gt;The Bostonians&lt;/em&gt; has the two strikes against it of being both old (as in of-a-time-that-is-difficult-to-inhabit) and spending its time making the repugnant argument that women are less then men. And yet - its characters are alive, are real people with great depth. I immediately fell into and was consumed by the story. And yeah, at the end, there is a kinda &lt;em&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/em&gt;-type ending where the unabashed misogonyst persuades the impressionable young woman to leave her life for him. And along the way there are a lot of confused arguments that are mostly nonsense now. I’m not really sure how it stood up in the context of its time, I am inclined to believe that James meant it to appeal to both “sides of the woman question” whatever that means. I mean all in all, it was more sympathetic to lesbians than you expect from a 19th century writer? Politics aside, it beats out &lt;em&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/em&gt; in at least being an admirable work of art.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;An interesting, well-researched, well-put together history of travel in the Amazon that I think unfortunately I read too shortly after reading &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/The-River-of-Doubt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The River of Doubt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is just kind of ultimately a better story about historical travel in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I think a book with these ambitions needs to be warm, organic, feel alive - but it is surprisingly cold and clinical. I’m not really sure what makes it so, maybe the storylines are too flat, maybe the characters lack depth. I think it was an admirable effort, well written and enjoyable and with am interesting goal, but ultimately I think it fell a bit flat&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;There is a bit here of the young-adult, which of course is nothing to be ashamed of, but means that it is a bit simplistic, a bit stilted, and a bit preoccupied by its own project. Which like, it’s a good project! Anticolonial linguistic magic in Victorian Oxford is fun! I like the project, I didn’t love the book.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Just good old fashioned juicy drama, a tragic soap opera, a tale of woe that is as scintillating now as it ever was. I mean, quite long-winded, it could be less long-winded. But brilliant, it sucks you in and surrounds with the history of this young lady, just doing her damndest so survive some horrible people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I’m only done with the first volume, but in my defense, it is long-winded. And I’ll come back for the rest&lt;/p&gt;
