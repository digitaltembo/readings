         <h3>Nolan Is Literate!</h3>

<p>I don’t do New Year’s resolutions, I think they are a bit pat - if one wanted a change, than one should change, regardless of the position of the earth around the sun.</p>

<p>Anyways, at the begining of 2023 I decided that I would for a period of time maybe roughly in line with a year or however long I think it would make sense, I would write a little bit about the books I have read.</p>

<p>This is effectively a continuation, an evolution of the practice that I have had for the past several years, of dutifully noting down each book that I have read and how I rated it according to the Goodreads star scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 star: hated</li>
  <li>2 stars: disliked</li>
  <li>3 stars: like</li>
  <li>4 stars: really liked</li>
  <li>5 stars: loved</li>
</ul>

<p>This practice has conciously been a bit silly - I disagree with both how that scale works and really just the concept of the scale as a whole. I don’t believe I have every rated something 1 star, and 2 stars are extremely rare because: why would I finish a book that I disliked? Mostly I land around 4 because I choose books that I think I will really like. And it fails to capture the different aspects that I really think of as constituting the book - th eprose, the plot, the characters, the entertainment value, the thought-provokedness, the humor.</p>

<p>But so I have been doing that for years and now I am at times worried that I am a bit of a bad reader, trained to get out of a book only whether I like it, really like it, or love it.</p>

<p>Hence this experiment: write a bit about each book that I read (or listen to, as I have started consuming a large number of audiobookse). Maybe become better at reading, maybe become better at writing, maybe become better at Communication and maybe just start doing something new. I am not attempting to make all “reviews” will be great or good or interesting, but I hope to use this to exercise muscles that are perhaps getting a bit flabby.</p>

<p>Because, I can read! ;)</p>
