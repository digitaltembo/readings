There is, for me, an undeniable allure in Svalbard and the Arctic (and Antarctic). Austere, windswept desolation, wide vistas, creatures eking out a living amongst the snow and ice - it is romantic. It feels so alien, so antithetical to my existence like no other place I can imagine. I have, of course, looked into visiting, living, being an IT person at a research station at the south pole or working as remotely in Svalbard (you hear good things, although finding housing is tricky). _The Memoirs of Stockholm Sven_ captures that attraction, the peril, the loneliness and the scurvy. It is, for all the hardships and pain, for my eyes a pleasant novel of a man finding a place that works for him and a community (small and maybe including some puppetized animal corpses) of kind and caring characters, well-written and compelling.
