I've been seeing references to Borges' story _Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote_ around a bit, for whatever reason (it is the one about Pierre Menard, through diligent scholarship, rewriting and recreating Don Quixote, line for line). And classic Borges it is a wonderfully compelling idea, what does it take to rewrite and recreate the conditions to write precisely the same story? I don't think I have it in me to recreate _Don Quixote_ but I think, given the time and motivation, I could recreate _Waiting for Godot_ line for line, word for word.

I'm not really sure what that says though. It is a pretty masterful play though, and I think I need to check out more Beckett.
