A bit of an odd coincidence, I did not realize when reading [His Majesty's Dragon](/blog/His-Majesty's-Dragon) that it was basically just _Master and Commander_ with dragons. And to be frank, I think the dragons did improve it a bit. I mean, I enjoyed this, it was enjoyable, it was maybe a bit long and not quite as compelling as one might hope the swashbuckling tale of naval adventure would be. I will most likely come back and continue the series at a future date. And, credit where credit is due, O'Brian is the first writer I've encountered with the temerity to use the word floccinaucinihilipilification, so he's really not that bad.
