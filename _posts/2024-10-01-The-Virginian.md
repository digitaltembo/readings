Good, solid, manly. Wister is clearly the Tolkein of the Western genre, and that caught me a bit by surprise - the seeds and bones of the genre are so clear and well-put, it feels like _The Virginian_ precisely predicts the existence of Clint Eastwood and Larry McMurtry. Also just kind of surprisingly unobjectionable.
