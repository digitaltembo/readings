Good fun! Pirates and mushrooms and sci-fi murder-mystery-leads-to-worldending-political-mystery, and they kiss in the end. Didn't really like the bit where I have to wait a while for the next book to come around, but if you do not find those things anathema to your reading experience, I think you would find this enjoyable.
