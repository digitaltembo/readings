I listened to Walden while walking through the woods around Walden, and I gotta say - the words still ring true. Yes, he was a few hours walk from Boston, yes his mom probably did his laundry for him and the whole experience is a bit silly on the face of it. But there is a pleasant earnestness and optimism to Thoreau's years in "the woods" that I can't help but admire.
