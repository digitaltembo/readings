This is a fascinating and insightful biography of both a guy I, an ignoramus, had not heard of, as well as of American foreign policy over the last half-century. Lots of good stuff here, sharply written, my biggest takeaway being that I am not entirely convinced that foreign policy actually effects change. I mean it probably does something?
