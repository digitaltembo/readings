It is a bit suspicious that this was published after Wes Anderson's _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ came out, but as much of a Anderson fanboy as I am, I think this may have done it better. Declining customs of an aristocratic hotel of the Old World, charm and poise pitted against the bureaucratic gray new age, a man out of place whose chief attribute is knowing how never to be out of place. Sweet, a bit twee, all in all quite solid, an excellent book to recommend to a grandmother or at least my grandmother.
