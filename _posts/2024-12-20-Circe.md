For a bit there at the beginning I thought this might just be a worthy follow up to _The Iliad_, _The Odyssey_, and _The Aeneid_. It is of course a logical follow up, with nearly flawless prose and a nice reinterpretation of what on the surface level represents you know, the correct modern thought about gender dynamics etc, telling the side of the that wasn't told and now society at large has some of the tools (feminism) to understand that side of the story. But as time went on, I think it ended up dropping the ball a bit - well-written but just not that meaningful or resonant.

...I mean, when it gets down to it, I didn't find Homer and Virgil to be that meaningful or to resonate with me, but they have the advantage of being like really old. And I _think_ I could feel that their stories were resonant with people at times, and with themselves, with a power that lasted through the ages. I think _Circe_ is much the story of the moment with superficial feminist ideas that do not stand super-well to scrutiny, and that at the end of the day this is more-or-less good genre fiction that doesn't leave me deeply affected, when I had a bit of hope for something more.
