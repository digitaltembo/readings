The thing is, [Gabriel García Márquez](/author/Gabriel-García-Márquez/) is tough competition. This is [_One Hundred Years of Solitude_](/blog/One-Hundred-Years-of-Solitude/) with worse writing and better politics, I am not likely the first to say, but the writing is in fact still briliant. The story is spectacular, intergenerational family epics are maybe my favorite genre? and in the end I cannot hold the mimicry against Allende. A wonderful book
