The thing is, Gabriel Garcia Marquez is tough competition. This is _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ with worse writing and better politics, I am not likely the first to say, but the writing is in fact still briliant. The story is spectacular, intergenerational family epics are maybe my favorite genre? and in the end I cannot hold the mimicry against Allende. A wonderful book
