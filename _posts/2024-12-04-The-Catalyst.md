Fascinating! This book blew my expectations out of the water with a beautiful combination of interesting anecdotes, histories, and explanations of basic science that is significantly more relevant to modern life than I was aware. Charming and well written, it takes its vast subject matter and presents its list of facts as a compelling story told over time.
