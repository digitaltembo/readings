I found this book to be rich, emotionally honest, and a timely discussion of handling politics and interpersonal interactions when it feels like things are out of control, inaccessible. I think there is a through-line here, a bit sketchy, from George Elliot to Dorris Lessig to Sallye Rooney, although I would not be surprised if I was the first to try and claim that. Maybe that through-line is just Women of the British Isles. But I think there is something in here about looking at the world and presenting a story that is at once intensely personal and revealing about societal structure, politics told from the first person perspective.

This reading I think remains true months later, but there was a also a bit of kismet in the timing here - following closely after reading the manly _The Virginian_, the chauvinistic _The Bostonians_, the staggering gender violence of _2666_, and the aptly named political biography _Our Man_, I was rather primed an oppositional power. Reviews are ostensibly of a single book, but the context of the literary world I was inhabiting at the time of reading will always have an impact, and this time, maybe a lot of impact. Maybe after all those books I would end up thinking basically anything following to be metonymy for Feminine Thought. And then this and the perfectly written _The Waves_. I can label these Feminine Thought and then justify my struggle to articulate what exactly I found good about them with an appeal to the Feminine Mystique. But: it does remain true, that I thought this book incredibly rich, and that is a different positive quality than what The Waves possessed. I think it is: _The Golden Notebook_ reveals truths about the world through intense introspection (or interrogation of the relation of the self to the world? Do those connections still count as introspection?) while _The Waves_ aims and achieves more universal truths. Or maybe it's all nonsense.

Anyways: I think Lessig is a very good writer.
