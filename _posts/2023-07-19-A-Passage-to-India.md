A Passage to India is a moral story of a friendship, and I want to be able to say that the moral story that it tells is of course completely obvious these days and is in fact full of its own failings - but the way that the Trial is held does I suppose still technically have something to say about how casual privilege. But like, its mostly obsolete and while definitely insightful for its time, does still make some mistakes of its own as a project of orientalism. And it was like a pretty good story, in general, and always love a story of a Friendship, and misunderstandings always tragic. So I don't think this is like a necessary or important read, but it is a worthy read.
