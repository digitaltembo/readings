_Life on Mars_ is great edutainment, clearly the work of people who are passionate about research, space, and space research. It is full of fun anecdotes and what seems like a difficult to assail argument that space colonization is not coming anytime soon - which, gotta say, is a bit sad to hear. The humor that defines the Weinersmith's brand is a bit thin, I imagine basically that it ended up being a bit less funny of a topic than they anticipated, and so perhaps it is a bit less entertaining than their _Soonish_ and Zach's _Open Borders_. Nevertheless, a fascinating read for anyone who thinks space is kind of neat.
