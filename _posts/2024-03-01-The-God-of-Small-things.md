Arundhati Roy might be the best living writer? I don't remember having that opinion last I read this, although I did apparently rate it 5 stars. The bubbling, overwrought prose is on the verge (perhaps past the verge) of Too Much - but it works, or it works for me, or it worked for me. Sweet, quick, lyrical, weird but grounded.
