Just good old fashioned juicy drama, a tragic soap opera, a tale of woe that is as scintillating now as it ever was. I mean, quite long-winded, it could be less long-winded. But brilliant, it sucks you in and surrounds with the history of this young lady, just doing her damndest so survive some horrible people.

I mean, I'm only done with the first volume, but in my defense, it is long-winded. And I'll come back for the rest
