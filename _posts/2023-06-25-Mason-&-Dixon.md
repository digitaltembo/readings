I think this is likely the best of Thomas Pynchon, one of the great novels of my lifetime, although I enjoyed his *Bleeding Edge* more. I don't know that I've read a better book that was written since I've been born. Better and good and great and enjoyable and exhilerating are all of course very different words, and it is for all of that not one of my favorite books, but. Masterful style, compelling history, quality story of Friendship and a pair in the lineage of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, awesome odyssey and the usual overbrimming of stories and side characters, framing devices and framed devices. It is, all in all, A Lot. But very good at it.
