As a not-teacher who has lived most of his life outside the humanities academy, this book is perhaps not super relevant - but it's good. I enjoyed reading about and thinking about what goes into education and Freeing the Mind, creating environments for thought and discourse conducive to greater understanding and appreciation of lived experiences. On one hand, it is fascinating insight into another profession, like traveling to a country with unfamiliar customs; on the other, teaching is not the only place where it is desirable to create a diverse, interesting environment for examination and proliferation of ideas! bell hooks seems pretty cool!
