For a boy named Hawkins growing up by the (fresh, decidedly not pirate-infested) water, _Treasure Island_ was a formative and exciting read about a boy named Hawkins traveling the world, finding pirates and treasure and friends. Rereading it to get in the proper headspace for dressing as a pirate for a costumed wedding - it holds up. Excellent swordfights and intrigue, and Long John Silver is to be sure a character for the ages.
