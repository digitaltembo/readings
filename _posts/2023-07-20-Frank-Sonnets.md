Poetry: hard to judge? I don't know how intrinsic that is, or how ignorant I am. I read through this because someone I know said it was important to them, and I wanted to see why. I think I can tell, think I can see the way the beauty represents itself and her and builds her in fragments throughout the sonnets, I can hear the (a) story she is telling and feel the things that I think she wants me to feel. But it is hard to tell, I think I need to read more bad poetry first.
