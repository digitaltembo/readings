I think a book with these ambitions needs to be warm, organic, feel alive - but it is surprisingly cold and clinical. I'm not really sure what makes it so, maybe the storylines are too flat, maybe the characters lack depth. I think it was an admirable effort, well written and enjoyable and with am interesting goal, but ultimately I think it fell a bit flat
