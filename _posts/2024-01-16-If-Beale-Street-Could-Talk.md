Most books I read which strive to be about the Black experience living in America are ultimately about trauma, for obvious reasons. _If Beale Street Could Talk_ also has its fair share of trauma and no happy ending - but the focus is instead powerful love, the love of a young couple and the love of the main character's family. It is a beautiful and moving piece.
