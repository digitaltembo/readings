Toni Morrison is perhaps the most powerful writer.

I wouldn't call this a fun read. It pristinely distills and presents raw trauma, in what I guess I could call a humane way. After I had a little cry after finishing this, I was wondering what positives can come out of it - and I think you have to fall back on the notion of storytelling itself as the positive. The ability to describe and grant humanity, to point out flaws and point at flaws and I guess, hopefully, to use recognition in a healing process? You just kind of have to hope that something beautiful can grow from the chasm.

Anyways its a great book, beautiful writing, horrible story
