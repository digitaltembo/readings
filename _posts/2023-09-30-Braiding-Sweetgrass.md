> Your strange hunger for ease should not mean a death sentence for the rest of the Creation.

_Braiding Sweetgrass_ is very much a book in a theme of books I have been reading this summer: [_Walden_](/blog/Walden) and [_Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_](/blog/Pilgrim-at-Tinker-Creek) and [_A Sand County Almanac_](/blog/A-Sand-County-Almanac), books full of beautiful writing about (more or less) living in greater accord with the natural world. Ultimately the persuasiveness of these books has not been terribly relevant to me, merely serving as aesthetic backgrounds to walks through the woods and fields and suburbs west of Boston - perhaps adding a bit of color to the way the light is shining through the leaves or the water gurgling through the creek. I am not reading them to adjust or even really re-evaluate my relationship with the earth; I recycle and compost, drive a hybrid and pay 2 cents more per kilowatt-hour for renewable electricity. _Braiding Sweetgrass_ is I think the most powerful of these - _Pilgrim_ looks about at things in wonder, _Sand County_ poses a question, and _Sweetgrass_ proffers a pointed answer (Thoreau is I guess just a lovable scamp in the cabin). The quote above got me, and the context and meaning in general was more resonant, three-dimensional, personal. Ecology is perhaps the coolest science.
