Gross - like if Terry Pratchett was a Vogon.

Vogons are of course famously humorless, in contrast with Pratchett, but there is a similarity of the structure, of the world-building. I had not really thought about Pratchett as a Fantasist instead of a humorist before, and maybe this is all a distraction, but the intricacy and entanglement of the world, the living, bleeding city feels like a twisted Steampunk-Noir version of Ankh-Morpork. The language is vivid (and gross) and the drama compelling. A fun and somewhat fresh take on fantasy, a weird and wild time.
