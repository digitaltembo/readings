I think the parts that I found interesting in this book, Liu Cixin did not. There are some intriguing concepts here, I think alien astronomy during the cultural revolution is a cool setting to explore...but there is a also a lot of tired lecturing about concepts that Liu Cixin seemed excited about like dimensional folding, VR, and a do-you-see-the-same-blue-as-I skepticism that drags down the story a bit. Maybe if they were completely unconsidered thoughts I would find the space they take up warranted? But it is just pretty standard scifi tropes, mostly. I may also be a bit biased because the narrator on the audio book kept doing silly voices like the gravelly detective that underlined how little novelty there was here.
