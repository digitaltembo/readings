I recently reread _Rosshalde_ because I was curious about an alternative to [_Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_](/blog/Tomorrow,-and-Tomorrow,-and-Tomorrow/) - an author exploring what it means to live as and pursue art in a non-linguistic medium. I found what feels more authentic, more meaningful and a bit more depressing. Hesse continues in my opinion after a few decades of reading him, to be Very Good...although this reads as maybe a bit more personal, a bit less generated towards a general audience. It is a quick read, a bit fraught, good stuff but probably would not be my first recommended book by Hesse for anyone.
