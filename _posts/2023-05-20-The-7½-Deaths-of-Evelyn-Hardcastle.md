Fun & funky pursuit of a killer and pursuite of the killt, whodunnit and also just whatdunandwen, little bit of Christie and a little bit of Groundhog day, and a little bit of (frankly, somewhat cumbersome) sci-fi oddity. That frame though allows for a novel premise and take on the classic dinner-party-and-a-murder that entertains and engrosses.

Bit of an odd sequel of The 7 Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and I believe it is followed by A Brief History of 7 Killings, am curious where this series will take me.
