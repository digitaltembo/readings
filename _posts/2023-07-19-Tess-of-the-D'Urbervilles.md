Excellently written compassionate treatment, love the murder, its funny<sup>\*</sup> how some mores seem so foreign and unimaginable and some mores seem to persist so strongly. I think what I found most brilliant was the different moral perspectives that Hardy sets up in every character along the way, each telling their own story and internally consistent and consistently wrong. It is a fun<sup>\*</sup> game to imagine which flavor of wrong I'd be transposed into another society. Thankfully I am here and always right.
