Murderbot continues to be a delight, maybe a bit more on the Real side with this one but still at the core the classic Murderbot running around, saving lives, struggling with Emotions, getting shot a few times. While quite enjoyable, I can't help but feel that the concept has about run it's course - and I hope Wells is onto something new soon. Can't really blame her for capitalizing on this to the extent that she has though.
