## The Potter of Bones

Fine I guess, decent writing and fun premise, but not much more than that, and doesn't really make me feel any which way - just "hmm yeah that seems a plausible story about darwin if he was an alien woman and I guess yeah evolution is kind of an interesting discovery."

## Rogue Farm

Good fun, I can get behind a bunch of people becoming a farm that tries to go to Jupiter

## The Little Goddess

I am maybe just a sucker for multiple consciousnesses inhering in a single mind, single body - but this is the first story that really trapped me. Kind of one of the drawbacks of short stories read for entertainment, you are either engaged and want more, or not. Irish guy writing about the future of India feels like a strong choice, but as an American, seems fairly reasonable. The robots are a bit boring though.

## Dead Man Walking

Something was almost here that I really would have loved, but it fell the tiniest bit flat, can't quite pinpoint why. Made me want to rewatch Altered Carbon.

## Tin Marsh

I feel like "driven to great resentment and violence and later placidity by the whims of capitalism" could maybe be a better story, but there wasn't all that much of interest to me here. Somebody's probably done it better, probably Steinbeck, and the trappings of scifi really don't do much.

## Good Mountain

Novel worldbuilding, sweet ecofuturism, classic apocalypse, becomes sneaky character study of a quirky gal - good stuff.

## Where the Golden Apples Grow

Maybe a good children's story? Are stories about kids always children's stories? I didn't find it all that engaging
