I think this makes an excellent pairing with [A Pilgrim at Tinker's Creek](/blog/Pilgrim-at-Tinker-Creek/). The one, a bright-eyed celebration of the beauty and majesty of being alive and able to experience nature, the other (A Sand County Almanac), a reflection with an older voice but many of the same goals - and importantly, a moral imprecation, and explicit proposal not merely to look at things with new eyes but to act on what you see. The challenge to work towards a governance and guardianship that grants moral weight to the land and the ecosystem is of course more important than ever, is aptly and intelligently put, and demands to be read.
