Quick (for Pynchon) fun (for Pynchon) jaunt through conspiratorial world of fresh-from-the-dot-com-collapse Silicon Alley, NYC; a modern take on film noir but like in books and also with computer stuff. A good mess to untangle with some snazzy characters and hijinks, the coarse barrage of people places and things might make you miss the fact that there are some pretty neat dynamics at play, insightful and honest! At his best, Pynchon falls into himself in a bit of an ouroboros of facts, figures, references, pedantry and pretension that goes for pages and pages and is...maybe...a bit tiresome actually - but this is perhaps not him at his best and instead just entertaining. I'll finish Gravity's Rainbow one of these days but in the meantime am happy to have found this one.
