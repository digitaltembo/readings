Pretty good, really! It is a bit tropey, the pirate mermaid is a good bit and some fun sociopolitical drama is scattered throughout, has a refreshing fantasy setting. I think, had I read this when I was younger, I would have loved it - but as it is, it did ring a little hollow, a little by-the-book, and when , 80% of the way in, I noticed that it was going to end on a cliffhanger setting up a sequel (series?) I was a bit dissapointed. I'll probably read the next, would honestly expect to enjoy it more.
