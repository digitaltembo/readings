A cute and lovely collection of prose on butterflies. The poetry - I've read some of Hesse's poetry before, and I can't really tell if he is a bad poet or it doesn't come across in translation? For a writer I love so much I am a bit inclined to believe the latter, but I mostly find his poetry lacking. But the prose is cute and lovely - if you are a fan of Hesse's work, it is definitely worth a quick peruse. And I learned that apparently Schmetterling is not the only German word for butterfly, which is heartening.
