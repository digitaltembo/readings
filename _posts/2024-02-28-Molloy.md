Maybe I am biased, predisposed by the forces of Canonized Culture, to find such great beauty in the stream-of-conscious depiction of a man (two? or just the one?) on an odyssey of his own making in Ireland - but this was really good. Rereading [_Waiting for Godot_](/blog/Waiting-for-Godot) made me think that huh, Beckett is pretty good. Reading this makes me think that Beckett, for all his worldwide fame, is under-appreciated? A potentially backhanded compliment: I think this should be on high-school curricula. Gotta love a miserable misanthrope, gotta love a confused bumbler, gotta love these slices of humanity.
