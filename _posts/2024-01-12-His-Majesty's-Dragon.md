One of my favorite book's growing up was _My Father's Dragon_, which I remember little about now - but did bias me pretty strongly against _His Majesty's Dragon_. I am an adult now! This looked like the lowest form of pablum. But really it's just pretty good pablum! An easy, comforting read, with sailboats and war and dragons, with problems presenting themselves and melting away, it is a book rightfully confident in its identity and a fun experience. It took me about 18 hours to get through, while _The Guermante's Way_ has been sitting by my bedside for the last 5 months.
