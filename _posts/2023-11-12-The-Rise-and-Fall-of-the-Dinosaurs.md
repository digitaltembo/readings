Brusatte takes you through an excellent history of both the dinosaurs themselves and the field of paleontology, from a few crazy pioneers (I could stand to learn a bit more about Baron Nopsca, scientist, swashbuckler and spy) to the high-tech science with computers and lasers it is today. What I found most amazing in this book is the particular way it seemed to anticipate precisely what I was curious about - whenever I started to wonder a bit about X, or how Y works, it would jump in with an excellent explanation, about how we know what the dinosaurs were eating or what color they were or how carbon dating works. Excellent, entertaining and informative, I just kinda wish I was a bit more of a Dinosaur Nerd growing up - which would have made this all the more mind-blowing.
