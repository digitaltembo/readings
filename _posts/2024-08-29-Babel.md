There is a bit here of the young-adult, which of course is nothing to be ashamed of, but means that it is a bit simplistic, a bit stilted, and a bit preoccupied by its own project. Which like, it's a good project! Anticolonial linguistic magic in Victorian Oxford is fun! I like the project, I didn't love the book.
