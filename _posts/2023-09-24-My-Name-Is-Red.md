Okok, that is a bit of an exaggeration, Bob Dylan's _Ballad of the Thin Man_ does not entirely apply here. There are some books that feel like they have an emotional core that my experiences do not quite allow me to relate to, or more precisely that I cannot not relate to in the _intended_ way. V. S. Naipul's [_The Mimic Men_](/blog/The-Mimic-Men/), Junot Diaz's [_This Is How You Lose Her_](/blog/This-Is-How-You-Lose-Her/) and to a lesser extent Arundhiti Roy's [_The Ministry of Utmost Happiness_](/blog/The-Ministry-of-Utmost-Happiness/) and Chimamanda Adichie's [_Americanah_](//blog/Americanah/) come to mind; while I may enjoy these books, parts of them remain inaccessible to me.

_My Name Is Red_ does not have that same inaccessibility - the plot, emotional journeys taken, some love and some murder, are all fairly universal, or at least become so after being beheld at the historical distance that it is. Instead what made this book more difficult is the cultural context whose canon is so unknown to me. Frustratingly, I can only blame this on my personal ignorances. Constantly throughout are references to the _Book of Souls_, _Book of Kings_, Tall Hasan and HÃ¼srev and Shirin, even names like Samarkand and Tamerlane and Suleyman the Magnificent that I recall as taking up half a paragraph in a history course a decade ago. These names are woven into stories, allegories which I can identify as such while struggling to find their referent, to grasp the underlying meaning and purpose. A man is murdered, three suspects tell three different tales each, relating to their philosophical interpretations of the purpose of art, and I become lost in the sea of names, struggling to differentiate the three.

Outside of this, the book is quite satisfying. The bejeweled, intricate and colorful prose from a perspective both distant and somewhat flattening echoes nothing else but the miniature paintings that are the core of the story - I think. It is not clear to me whether my aesthetic interpretation of the prose accurately reflects an intentional parallelism with the content, or merely comes about as a result of the content. I'm not sure it matters either way: the prose is good.

And the story is good too, burbling up with shifting frame of storytelling and other stories in a style reminiscent of Italo Calvino's [_If on a winter's night a traveler_](/blog/If-on-the-winters-night-a-traveler/), reflecting on art and its production. And then in its murder-mystery-entangled-in-art-and-history, reminiscent of Umberto Eco's _The Name of the Rose_ and (no aspersion's intended) Dan Brown's [_The Da Vinci Code_](</blog/The-Da-Vinci-Code-(Robert-Langdon,-2)/>) - a beautiful trail of logic and analysis coming down to the nostril's of a heretically drawn horse.
