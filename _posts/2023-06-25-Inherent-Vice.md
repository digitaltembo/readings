When it comes down to it, this is basically just _Bleeding Edge_ but with more Genre. Enjoyable enough as a detective mystery, and the counterculture voice is kind of fun - and, as I listened to the audiobook, Ron McLarty's performance of the various Pynchonian songs and lyrical tidbits (that I normally end up skimming over) was a delight. I was generally expecting more, but probably would make a good gateway novel by him.
