Reading Christie I am frequently struck with the thought: why isn't Christie more popular? And then I remember that she is the best selling novelist of all time - Wikipedia currently has her tied with the bard, but he was hardly a novelist. So I guess maybe the fault is with me, or with my cultural bubble, for not reading her earlier. Probably blame the bubble.

Anyways, she is great, and _And Then There Were None_ is my favorite by her so far. It's got no charming detective, no innocents of any sort, but instead just pages and pages of cold bloody murder on an island. My reading of the tale (an identical twin of course! maybe inspired by a recent movie) was apparently wrong and the twist satisfylingly twisty. It reads like an elegantly constructed puzzle box. What more could you want?
