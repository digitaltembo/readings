I think Isabelle Allende is a Very Good writer, deep and heartfelt, and the book a topical and compelling story of immigration and the toll it takes, especially at the US border. I don't think she is a Great writer, and I struggle to articulate why. I think it is the language - fluid, fluent it compels further reading, but it is almost voiceless, and for that it is less interesting. Perhaps a bit insulting of a comparison, but it reminds me of Steven King; the words come with ease, but don't stick. Her plot and emotional depth is better though, so that's nice.
