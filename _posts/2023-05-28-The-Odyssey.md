My thoughts on the Odyssey are largely similar to my thoughts on the Iliad, in the extent to which this story told millenia ago about a people and a culture distant in all manors from mine remains engaging, entertaining, and apparently well crafted is of course remarkable. It is clearly apparent why the Odyssey is more referenced and revered than its sibling the Illiad, focusing on the more personal story, hitting more of the familiar Hero's Journey archetype, which is so much more common today than the Hero is Sad about his Slave Being Taken Away But Gets Better And Fights Everyone and Then There Is a Tournament archetype. Good enough that it is probably worthy of a read beyond just being one of the most influential stories of the western canon.
