<h3>Nolan Is Literate!</h3>

I don't do New Year's resolutions, I think they are a bit pat - if one wanted a change, than one should change, regardless of the position of the earth around the sun.

Anyways, at the begining of 2023 I decided that I would for a period of time maybe roughly in line with a year or however long I think it would make sense, I would write a little bit about the books I have read.

This is effectively a continuation, an evolution of the practice that I have had for the past several years, of dutifully noting down each book that I have read and how I rated it according to the Goodreads star scale:

- 1 star: hated
- 2 stars: disliked
- 3 stars: like
- 4 stars: really liked
- 5 stars: loved

This practice has conciously been a bit silly - I disagree with both how that scale works and really just the concept of the scale as a whole. I don't believe I have every rated something 1 star, and 2 stars are extremely rare because: why would I finish a book that I disliked? Mostly I land around 4 because I choose books that I think I will really like. And it fails to capture the different aspects that I really think of as constituting the book - th eprose, the plot, the characters, the entertainment value, the thought-provokedness, the humor.

But so I have been doing that for years and now I am at times worried that I am a bit of a bad reader, trained to get out of a book only whether I like it, really like it, or love it.

Hence this experiment: write a bit about each book that I read (or listen to, as I have started consuming a large number of audiobookse). Maybe become better at reading, maybe become better at writing, maybe become better at Communication and maybe just start doing something new. I am not attempting to make all "reviews" will be great or good or interesting, but I hope to use this to exercise muscles that are perhaps getting a bit flabby.

Because, I can read! ;)
